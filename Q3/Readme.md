# Performance test

Create unit test comparison and attach report output for 100, 1000, 100000 operations. Explain briefly each data structure implementation characteristics. The following bullets ilustrates each step taken to complete this Question.

- Evaluate Insert, Remove and get element by index operations for:
..* ArrayList
..* LinkedList
..* Vector

- Evaluate get, put and remove operations for:
..* HashMap
..* LinkedHashMap

### Results

The following image shows the unit tests for each data structure, as well as the elapsed time to insert/put, get and remove 10, 100 and 1000 elements.
