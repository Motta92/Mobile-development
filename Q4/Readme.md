# Implementing the Strategy patterns

In this exercise I had to use the strategy pattern to sort a list of students by 3 different rules implemented by me. The following bullets ilustrates each step taken to complete this Question.

- Create the Student class (create attributes).

- Create an Interface called IComparisonStretegy.

- Create 3 comparison Strategies that you design.

- Create a class sorter that receives a Strategy and then
filters the list based on the given rule.

- Provide unit test example for each designed strategy.
