# Question # 2

2. Explain what is an Interface, an Abstract class and a static field. Provides code examples for each one. 

### Interface Class

An interface provides a blueprint that defines the behaviour of the class without implementing functionality, in other words, an empty body defining only desired behaviour. This is generally used to promote high cohesion between classes without directly affecting classes. Technically speaking, an interface is a class that cannot contain an implementation of the defined methods. Basically, it can only contain method signatures and fields. This enables polymorphism, as it defines a common class with general functionalities that can be used as a superclass class for the classes that inherit from it. 

Also, when Implementing an interface, there are important considerations listed below.

- All methods must be implemented and have the same method signatures and fields.

- Variables does not need to be implemented or to explicitly declare them, and cannot be reassigned. 
-  You must always create an instance of some class that implements the interface, in other words, instances of the interface cannot be created without the aid of an instance that implements the interface.
- A java class can reference multiple interfaces, but all methods must be implemented.
- It is up to you to decide how to handle overlapping method signatures when implementing multiple interfaces with the same signatures.
- Attributes of an interface are set to public by default.

### Abstract Class

An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated, it is used to define a template for its subclasses.

Also, when implementing an Abstract Class, there are important considerations listed below.

- Abstract methods have no implementation.
- Subclasses of an abstract class must implement all abstract methods of its abstract superclass.
- Non-abstract methods can be overriden if needed.

### Static Field

A java field is a variable inside of a class, such as: 

```sh

string name; 

```

Fields can be static or non-static. In this case, a static field belongs to a class and not to the objects instanciated from it. Therefore, if the value of a static field will be the same for everyone. The following image illustrates how static fields work.

### Code Examples

- **Interface**

```sh

public interface loadFile {
	public void load();
}

public class loadFileTxt implements loadFile {
	private string txtName;
	private string txtFile;

	public void load(){
		this.txtFile = getFile(this.txtName,'txt');
	}
}

```

- **Abstract Class**

```sh

public abstract Vehicle {
	protected string hello = "Hello, i am a vehicle";

	public abstract void startEngine();
}

public class Car implements Vehicle {
	public void salute(){
		System.out.println(this.hello); 
	}

	public void startEngine(){
		System.out.println("Starting engine on my car!");
	}
}

```
- **Static Field** 

```sh

public class Counter {
	public static int currentCtr = 1;
}

Counter.currentCtr = Counter.currentCtr + 1;

```
