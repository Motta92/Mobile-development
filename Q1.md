# Question # 1
Explain the difference between a Map, List and Set on Java. Give examples(3) for the use of each one.

### Map

As referenced in java 7 documentation, Map is an interface, which is a member of the Java Collentions Framework. A Map takes two parameters, a key K and a value V. A Aap object maps keys to values, and these keys cannot be duplicate.

### List

As referenced in java 7 documentation, List is also an interface, and a member of the Java Collections Framework. A List is an ordered sequence or collection. A list has one parameter, which indicates the type of the elements in the list. Lists provide precise control over where in the list each element is inserted, as well as accessing elements given their index.

### Set

As referenced in java 7 documentation, Set is also an interface, and a member of the Java Collections Framework. A set has one paramenter, which indicates the type of elements maintained by the set. A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and at most one null element as well. 

### Differences

Map, List and Set are interfaces that share similar functionalities. List and Set extends from Collections, which enables them to share common methods that have clear restrictions bounded to each interace, such as Sets having the no-duplicate restriction. On the other hand, Map is not technically a Collection, but they have Collection-view operations, which enable them to be manipulated as if they were colletions. More specifically, Map stores a value V in the given key K, behaving as a Dictionary, while a List is zero based, therefore behaves more like a sequence of elements. And a Set follows the mathematical rules of an actual Set, therefore there is no order or key associated each element.
