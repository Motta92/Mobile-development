# Question # 2

2. Explain what is an Interface, an Abstract class and a static field. Provides code examples for each one. 

### Interface

An interface is a class that cannot contain an implementation of the defined methods. Basically, it can only contain method signatures and fields. This enables polymorphism. 

Also, when Implementing an interface, there are important considerations listed below.

- All methods must be implemented and have the same method signatures and fields.

- Variables does not need to be implemented or to explicitly declare them. 

-  

### Abstract Class

An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated, it is used to define a baseline for its subclasses.

Also, when implementing an Abstract Class

### Static Field

### Code Examples

- Interface

Public interface Vehicle{
	public string hello = "Hello, i am a vehicle";
	public string brand;
	public string plate;

	public void startEngine();
	public void move();

}

- Abstract Class

- Static Field
